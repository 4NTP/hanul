description: UI component library rules using shadcn patterns and Tailwind CSS

UI Library Standards

- Components
  - Follow shadcn patterns for composition and variants.
  - Export from `src/components/*` and re-export via package `exports`.
  - Prefer `class-variance-authority` for variants and `tailwind-merge` for class merging.
  - Prefer importing or adapting components from shadcn when possible to ensure consistency and accessibility.

- Styles
  - Centralize theme tokens and scales in `globals.css`.
  - Avoid magic numbers; respect spacing/typography/color scales.
  - Dark mode compatibility by default; test contrast.

- API Design
  - Keep props minimal and typed; avoid overly generic `any` props.
  - Provide sensible defaults; opt-in for advanced behaviors.

- Accessibility
  - Use Radix primitives when available; ensure proper ARIA.
  - Keyboard navigation must be supported.

- Performance
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders; prefer pure components.
  - Tree-shakeable exports; no side-effects in index.

- Animation
  - Provide a continuous, cohesive experience by using animations thoughtfully to guide focus and state changes.
  - Use `tw-animate-css` for animations; prefer utility classes over custom keyframes unless necessary.
  - Keep durations/easings consistent across components; respect motion-reduce and offer non-animated fallbacks.
